31 August 2013 (0.5.3)
 * Add convert_seconds() method to katcp client classes that converts
   seconds into the device timestamp format.

24 April 2013 (0.5.2)
 * Fix memory leak in sample reactor when replacing sensor strategies
 * Minor error reporting improvements in sampling strategies
 * Fix 2012 -> 2013 in changelog :)

8 March 2013 (0.5.1)
 * Minor code comment cleanups
 * Minor documentation and docstring updates
 * Fix twisted katcp server's on-connect inform messages to be consistent
   with the selected katcp version
 * Improve error messages when an invalid sensor sampling strategy is set
 * Fix bug in event-rate sampling strategy where events were sent whenever a sensor
   object is updated, even if the value is unchanged. Also fixes same
   bug for the event sampling strategy, since it uses the event-rate
   code for its implementation
 * Work around potential CPU livelock when sending messages and the network
   buffers are full by using timeouts. Problem will be properly solved when the
   current networking code is replaced by twisted.
 * Fixed some buggy logger calls
 * Improve the handling of sensor removal from the sensor tree
 * made server main event loop robust against disconnect race-conditions when
   looking up the client connection object


29 January 2013 (0.5.0)
 * Minor documentation updates
 * Version 0.5.0 relesed

13 December 2012 (0.5.0a0)
 * Add support for protocol flags to katcp.core -- a standard
   data structure for storing KATCP versions and capabilities
 * Clean-up various bits of code, docstring fixes, etc.
 * katcp.Message constructors are now strict about unknown keyword arguments
 * Add clear_strategies() method to server class to clear all sampling
   strategies for a connection.
 * Support for serving either KATCP v4 or v5
   * sensor timestamp conversions as needed
   * log timestamp conversion as needed
   * kattypes decorators can be configured for the appropriate protocol versions
   * generate appropriate on-connect messages
 * Support for being a client of ether KATCP v4 or v5
   * Auto-detect server version using on-connect informs
   * Add ability for clients to wait until protocol information is received from
     server
 * Refactor use of raw 'sock' object as a connection identifier
   * Abstract sock to a transport-neutral connection object
   * Pass a request-bound connection object to request handlers, rather than a
     raw socket. Automatically use the right name and mid for informs and replies
   * Deprecate use of self.reply(sock, ....) and self.reply_inform(sock,
     ....). Rather use req.reply(...), req.reply_with_message(...),
     req.inform(...)
 * Renamed CallbackClient.request to callback_request to be more consistent with
   superclass API
 * Add sensor construction class methods, e.g. Sensor.integer(...), rather than
   Sensor(Sensor.INTEGER, ...)
 * Removed non-standard rate-limit extension from 'event' sample strategy
   implementation. KATCP v5 event-rate strategy covers that use case.
 * Fix race condition between timeout and reply handlers
 * Various improvements to tests and testutils to make tests more robust and
   (sometimes) faster
 * Add implementation of subset of new KATCP v5 features
   * Add Address sensor type
   * Implement ?version-list and #version-connect
   * Add 'unreachable' and 'inactive' sensor states
   * Make float and integer sensor ranges optional and informational.
   * Add Message Identifier (mid) support. Enabled by default in client
     for servers that support mids.
   * Use seconds instead of milliseconds for all timestamps and periods (except
     when explicitly configured to use an older KATCP, see multi-version support
     above)
 * Version 0.5.0a0 released

18 September 2012
 * PEP-8 cleanup of code.
 * Store sensor state as a tuple to allow 'atomic' read.
 * Use nose as the default test runner.
 * Fix thread leak in callback client when async requests are outstanding when
   the client is being shut down.
 * Fix server deadlock on sensor strategy lock at shutdown.
 * Add variable number of arguments support to kattypes decorators.
 * Version 0.3.5 released -- Should be last public release adhering to the KATCP
   v4 specifications. Next release should be based on the KATCP v5
   specifications.

   documentation.

12 Oct 2010:
 * Add regular expression pattern support to ?sensor-list and ?sensor-value
   requests.

8 Oct 2010:

28 Sep 2010:
 * Refactor Twisted KATCP into katcp.tx sub-package.
 * Update and flesh out example KATCP server.

27 Sep 2010:
 * Implementation of Twisted KATCP proxy. A proxy mutliplexes queries and
   sensor sampling from a single client to multiple KATCP servers.

17 Sep 2010:
 * Completion of Twisted KATCP DeviceServer.

16 Aug 2010:
 * Implementation of __eq__ and __ne__ for katcp.Message.

30 Jul 2010
 * katcp.katcp renamed to katcp.core to avoid module name clashing with
   package name.
 * Allow Python types to be used in addition to katcp.Sensor object types
   when constructing sensors.

27 Jul 2010
 * Custom __repr__ for katcp.Message added.

22 Jul 2010
 * Initial sensor tree implementation. A sensor tree is a directed acyclic
   graph of sensor dependencies. The tree triggers updates of dependent
   sensors when dependee sensors change.

15 Jul 2010
 * Start of work on Twisted katcp client and server implementations.

13 Jul 2010
 * Major rework of katcp.testutils.

11 Mar 2010
 * Add check to client to bail out of re-trying sends if the client
   has disconnected.

02 Feb 2010
 * Allow adding and removing sensors on the fly.

20 Jan 2010
 * Allow logging using .warn(fmt, arg1, arg2, ...) format as used
   in Python logging (allows msg formatting to be delayed until it
   is known whether the message will actually be logged).

26 Oct 2009
 * Add include_msg option to request decorator to give decorated
   requests a means to access the original message and the message id.
 * Add support for msg ids to callback client. 

23 Oct 2009
 * Add support for message ids to server and client request handling.
   * Server gained new .reply() and .reply_inform() methods that set
     message ids.
   * Server had .send_message() moved to ._send_message() since it is
     now rather important to use .reply() and .reply_inform() when
     replying. Old servers will need to upgrade. Calls to .send_message()
     should be replaced with calls to either .reply(), .reply_inform() or
     .inform(). Calls to .inform() should be changed to calls to
     .reply_inform() if they are part of the response to a request.
   * Client request handler handles message ids correctly.

22 Oct 2009
 * Add support for message ids to KATCP message and message parser classes.

21 Oct 2009
 * Add blocking_request implementation to callback client.
 * Reduce client sleep to 0.5s (from 1.0s) to make shutdown more responsive.
 * Add Message.reply_ok() method for checking that a message represents
   a successful reply.

07 Oct 2009
 * Fix bug in new callback client time outs.

05 Oct 2009
 * Support for commands timing out in callback client.

21 Sep 2009
 * Fix bug in client run loop where self._sock could become
   None while it was being used by select(..) and .recv(...).

02 Sep 2009
 * Implement TimestampOrNow kattype.

01 Sep 2009
 * Fix bug where AUTO strategy did not set updates on connect.

26 Aug 2009
 * Downgrade logging of successful request handling to DEBUG log level.

29 Jul 2009
 * Enable TCP_NODELAY on server and client sockets since katcp protocol messages
   are often small.

22 Jul 2009
 * Update version to 0.2.x.
 * Fix download url and license in setup.py.
 * Have Sphinx read the version number from katcp.VERSION and katcp.VERSION_STR.
 
29 Jun 2009
 * Start of CHANGELOG in preparation for 0.1.0 release.
