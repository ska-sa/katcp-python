 * Add support for message ids to server and client request handling.
   * Server gained new .reply() and .reply_inform() methods that set
     message ids.
   * Server had .send_message() moved to ._send_message() since it is
     now rather important to use .reply() and .reply_inform() when
     replying. Old servers will need to upgrade. Calls to .send_message()
     should be replaced with calls to either .reply(), .reply_inform() or
     .inform(). Calls to .inform() should be changed to calls to
     .reply_inform() if they are part of the response to a request.
   * Client request handler handles message ids correctly.

22 Oct 2009
 * Add support for message ids to KATCP message and message parser classes.

21 Oct 2009

 * Add Message.reply_ok() method for checking that a message represents
   a successful reply.
