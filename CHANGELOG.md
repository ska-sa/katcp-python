* Put docs on readthedocs (PR #192).
* Added error handling when parsing Message arguments that include non-ASCII
  characters (not following KATCP specification).  Invalid characters are replaced
  with question marks, possibly breaking functionality (PR #193).
* Increase container sync time from 8 sec to 20 sec, and initial resync
  timeout from 1 sec to 5 sec, to better support large containers (PR #194).
* Limit tornado version to <5 because the openssl version on Ubuntu 14.04
  is not compatible (PR #195).

  working with devices that dynamically remove sensors (PR #196).
* Provide a meaningful error message for the DeviceMetaClass assert statements
  (PR #198).
* Increase server's MAX_QUEUE_SIZE from 30 to 300 to handle more simultaneous
  client connections (PR #199).  (Not in release 0.6.3 - it was only on the
  release/karoocamv20 branch)
* Updates to Jenkinsfile for pipeline improvements (PR #200, #201, #202).
* Add information on how to contribute to the project (PR #203).

19 July 2017 (0.6.2)
 * Bumped the tornado dependency to at least 4.3
 * Started work to support for python3 (not production ready)
 * Added the ability to let ClientGroup wait for a quorum of clients
   Give ClientGroup.wait() the ability to wait until a subset of clients
   (a 'quorum') satisfy a sensor condition.
 * Added an until_some helper function
 * Added timeout hints usage to the resource client
 * Added default request-timeout-hint implementation to server.py
   It is only activated if the server protocol is set to the (proposed) KATCP v5.1
   spec and the timeout hint protocol flag is enabled.
 * Moved IOLoopThreadWrapper to ioloop_manager.py, a more sensible location
 * Improved unit test coverage and implementation in some cases
 * Started work on implementing an async device handler
 * Numerous docstring and code style improvements throughout

 * Fixed a bug where model updates were never sent by the inspecting client
   callback when sensor sync failed
 * Changed the __str__ method for InspectingClientStateType to be more compact

 * Fixed inspecting client from losing units values
 * Avoid blocking python interpreter shutdown and avoid leaking file descriptors
 * Improved setup.py dependencies and removed pip-build-requirements.txt
 * Allow high level clients to preset KATCP flags
 * Simplify sensor wait() interface
 * Added a check that the sensor exists before removing it
 * Better handling of malformed log lines
 * Use katversion and git tags to determine package version on install

 15 June 2016 (0.6.0)
 * Added high level, simple to use, client API (KATCPResource) that connects to,
   inspects and presents a high level, hierarchical object oriented interface to
   multiple KATCP devices.
 * Added mid level client API (InspectingClient) that abstracts the inspection
   of a KATCP device.
 * Backwards-incompatible change in Sensor observer API
 * Sensor strategies now call back with raw Python datatype values rather than
   KATCP formatted values, using the same 'reading' API as Sensor
   observers' update methods.
 * Tornado ioloop / iostream based sensor sampling
 * Tornado ioloop / iostream based server
 * Sever message handlers can now return futures
 * Server supports fully async mode with Tornado futures.
 * Threaded message handle compatibility mode + new Async mode (performance
   penalty for threaded mode, but is default for now)
 * Tornado ioloop / iostream based client AsyncClient, single implementation for
   both BlockingClient and CallbackClient based on thin wrapper around
   AsyncClient.
 * Clients now stop much faster due to removal of 0.5s select timeout in
   previous implementation.
 * Backwards incompatible change in BlockingClient.blocking_request(): now
   returns a failed reply rather than raising an exception for timeouts (like
   CallbackClient.blocking_request() always did).
 * Threadsafe mode (default for BlockingClient and CallbackClient) available, but
   comes with performance overhead even async for usage.
 * Hundreds of test-suite reliablility improvements.

14 July 2014 (0.5.5)
 * Add utility code to katcp.version.py that other modules can use to parse svn
   or git revisions for use in build-state informs or sensors
 * Add katcp.client.request_check: a convenience function for making KATCP
   requests and raising an exception if there is an error.
 * Add katcp.testutils.handle_mock_req() to allow mocked testing of server request
   handlers and dispatch, removing the need to start() a DeviceServer for
   handler tests.
 * Make katcp.testutils.WaitingMock robust against race conditions
 * Explicitly list set of base KATCP requests in katcp.server.BASE_REQUESTS
 * Make method-name to KATCP-name function available outside KATCP server
   metaclass
 * Improvements to logging (i.a. prevents issues when using SocketHandler)
 * Docstring cleanups

10 June 2013 (0.5.4)

   changed and shortest-period has passed
 * Add differential-rate strategy

31 August 2013 (0.5.3)
 * Add convert_seconds() method to katcp client classes that converts
   seconds into the device timestamp format.

24 April 2013 (0.5.2)
 * Fix memory leak in sample reactor when replacing sensor strategies
 * Minor error reporting improvements in sampling strategies
 * Fix 2012 -> 2013 in changelog :)

8 March 2013 (0.5.1)
 * Minor code comment cleanups
 * Minor documentation and docstring updates
 * Fix twisted katcp server's on-connect inform messages to be consistent
   with the selected katcp version
 * Improve error messages when an invalid sensor sampling strategy is set
 * Fix bug in event-rate sampling strategy where events were sent whenever a sensor
   object is updated, even if the value is unchanged. Also fixes same
   bug for the event sampling strategy, since it uses the event-rate
   code for its implementation
 * Work around potential CPU livelock when sending messages and the network
   buffers are full by using timeouts. Problem will be properly solved when the
   current networking code is replaced by twisted.
 * Fixed some buggy logger calls
 * Improve the handling of sensor removal from the sensor tree
 * made server main event loop robust against disconnect race-conditions when
   looking up the client connection object

   * Auto-detect server version using on-connect informs
   * Add ability for clients to wait until protocol information is received from
     server
 * Refactor use of raw 'sock' object as a connection identifier
   * Abstract sock to a transport-neutral connection object
   * Pass a request-bound connection object to request handlers, rather than a
     raw socket. Automatically use the right name and mid for informs and replies
   * Deprecate use of self.reply(sock, ....) and self.reply_inform(sock,
     ....). Rather use req.reply(...), req.reply_with_message(...),
     req.inform(...)
 * Renamed CallbackClient.request to callback_request to be more consistent with
   superclass API
 * Add sensor construction class methods, e.g. Sensor.integer(...), rather than
   Sensor(Sensor.INTEGER, ...)
 * Removed non-standard rate-limit extension from 'event' sample strategy
   implementation. KATCP v5 event-rate strategy covers that use case.
 * Fix race condition between timeout and reply handlers
 * Various improvements to tests and testutils to make tests more robust and
   (sometimes) faster

   when constructing sensors.

27 Jul 2010
 * Custom __repr__ for katcp.Message added.

22 Jul 2010
 * Initial sensor tree implementation. A sensor tree is a directed acyclic
   graph of sensor dependencies. The tree triggers updates of dependent
   sensors when dependee sensors change.

15 Jul 2010
 * Start of work on Twisted katcp client and server implementations.

13 Jul 2010
 * Major rework of katcp.testutils.

   has disconnected.

02 Feb 2010
 * Allow adding and removing sensors on the fly.

20 Jan 2010
 * Allow logging using .warn(fmt, arg1, arg2, ...) format as used
   in Python logging (allows msg formatting to be delayed until it
   is known whether the message will actually be logged).

26 Oct 2009
 * Add include_msg option to request decorator to give decorated
   requests a means to access the original message and the message id.
 * Add support for msg ids to callback client.

23 Oct 2009
 * Add support for message ids to server and client request handling.
   * Server gained new .reply() and .reply_inform() methods that set
     message ids.
   * Server had .send_message() moved to ._send_message() since it is
     now rather important to use .reply() and .reply_inform() when
     replying. Old servers will need to upgrade. Calls to .send_message()
     should be replaced with calls to either .reply(), .reply_inform() or
     .inform(). Calls to .inform() should be changed to calls to
     .reply_inform() if they are part of the response to a request.
   * Client request handler handles message ids correctly.

22 Oct 2009
 * Add support for message ids to KATCP message and message parser classes.

21 Oct 2009
 * Add blocking_request implementation to callback client.

 * Fix bug in new callback client time outs.

05 Oct 2009
 * Support for commands timing out in callback client.

21 Sep 2009

 * Fix bug where AUTO strategy did not set updates on connect.

26 Aug 2009
 * Downgrade logging of successful request handling to DEBUG log level.

29 Jul 2009
 * Enable TCP_NODELAY on server and client sockets since katcp protocol messages
   are often small.

22 Jul 2009
 * Update version to 0.2.x.
 * Fix download url and license in setup.py.
 * Have Sphinx read the version number from katcp.VERSION and katcp.VERSION_STR.

29 Jun 2009
 * Start of CHANGELOG in preparation for 0.1.0 release.
